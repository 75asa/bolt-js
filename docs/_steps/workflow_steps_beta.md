Workflow Steps from apps allow your app to create and process custom workflow steps that users can add using [Workflow Builder](https://api.slack.com/workflows).

A workflow step is made up of three distinct user events: workflow builders adding or editing the step, saving or updating the step's configuration, and the end user's execution of the step. All three events must be handled for a workflow step to function.

The [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/workflows/steps) includes more information on setting up your app.
